# Lab 2: Todo

Let's create a simple todo app. This can be done with a single model `TodoItem` which contains a text description, a created date, a completed date, and a boolean representing whether it was completed. The user should be presented with an input field and a button (in a form). When the clicks the button, it should save the data to the server and show the newly-added item in the list.

##Version Two
Create a second model for lists and a related field for todos on that model. Make a page where all lists are shown with their related to-dos.
